Kubernetes API reference
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.22/

-------
SERVICE
-------
* Service will have a clusterIP (Virtual IP)
* It forwards the requests to one of the matching pods -> based on labels and selectors

----------
KUBE PROXY
----------
* Each node will have a kube-proxy
* Kube-proxy will ensure that the networking will work
* Load balance traffic that is desired for services via ClusterIP and node ports
* Kube-Proxy can run in one of three modes
    1. Userspace (Kubernetes is no longer using the userspace)
    2. iptables
    3. IPVS (This is choosen usually in production - more efficient - CNI installed will choose)
